# hello-world
The first of many

Greetings everyone!

The name is Stephan, and I'm going to create a videogame company. This is just the start. I
do not know exactly when it will happen but it shall happen. It will have games paying homages
to Silent Hill, Devil May Cry, Wild Arms, Megaman, Streets of Rage etc, etc. Originally I want
to work with various companies to bring something new to their franchises, and in my heart I still
do. However, if that does not go through, I'll gather a team to create these styled games. Taking the
vast library of Capcom, the quality control of Nintendo, music of Sega, and the zaniness of Platinum.
An aim to create worlds wherever possible.
